The evolving UNLS Node Dictionary adheres to a strict node definition heirarchy in order to effectively be used in the system. 
Words are being added and refined on a regular basis currently using a [not found] log collecting words that are not found from the automated parsing sentence analysis form found here: https://journalofexpresearch.com/UNLS/
The form uses the dictionary to parse sentences and provide nodes for sentence analysis.

The overall goal is to collect and refine the entire english language into the dictionary, which can then be translated into other languages as the nodes are universally applicable. (See case study: Universal Languages)
